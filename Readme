Instructions to execute
Server
	1. gcc -o server shirisha_server.c -pthread
	2. ./server
Client
	1. gcc -o client shirisha_client.c
	2. ./client

* Send message from client first.
* Send message from server to the client.

Start sending message from and client and then reply from server
Every chat should start from client and end from server
Send one message each time
To send another message start from client again and end by sending message from server
Same for multiple clients

The code works when client and server are from same system.
To execute server and client from different system:
	//get the address of server
	1. hostname -i 
	//change this line in the client program
	2. clientAddress.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(address of the server);
